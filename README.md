Western kingdom of Cletta has an olive color for a base color and sky blue for an accent color. 
The logo and the uniform designs are based on USA and Italy creating a rich, powerful yet elegant look for this team.

### Imperata

Eastern kingdom - Imperata got a spinach color for a base color (in some 
cases the base color is gray though) and a garish red for an accent color. The emblem and the uniform designs are based on Russia, Germany, and France which makes Imperata look strong, savage and menacing.
